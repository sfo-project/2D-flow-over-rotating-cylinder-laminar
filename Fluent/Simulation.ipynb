    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Following is the step-by-step explanation for each of the above command/setting procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study the incoming free stream flow is uniform and steady. However, the flow field's Reynolds number, based on the cylinder diameter, will surpassed the critical Reynolds number of 50. Meaning that within the flow the effect and significance of the inertial forces will dominate over the viscous forces. This leads to flow separation from the top and bottom surface of the cylinder and alternative vortex shedding into the cylinder's wake. These factors contribute to making the flow field unsteady, or transient. Therefore, the Transient model is chosen to develop the CFD simulation: `/define/models/solver/transient`. In cases that the flow field Reynolds number, based on cylinder diameter, is less than the critical value of 50 the chosen model will still be viscous, however the steady model should be selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in this problem the flow is in a subsonic regime. This allows the variation of density with respect to pressure to be neglected. As a result of this assumption one can define the working fluid to be incompressible: `define/models/solver/pressure-based`. In cases that the speed of the flow enters sonic and supersonic regimes ( Mach # > 0.3), the changes in density (i.e. compressibility) of the flow will be an important factor and the solver must be defined as density-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this case study is to investigate the formation and separation of the laminar boundary layer on the rotating walls of a cylinder as a uniform flow passes over it. Therefore, the flow regime is laminar and the appropriate model for that is selected via `/define/models/viscous/laminar`. The critical Reynolds number for flow over cylinder to make the transition from laminar to turbulent regime is about 3.0E+5. In cases that the Reynolds number, based on cylinder diameter, is greater than the critical value of 3.0E+5 the model will still be viscous, however the appropriate turbulent model should be selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, match the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainty in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the basis for expected physical observations. For this problem using `/define/material/change-create/` command, user can define a new material named `Reynolds_50` and set it's density to 50 [kg/m^3] and it's viscosity to 1 [kg/m.s]. Based on the 1 [m] diameter of the cylinder the Reynolds number for this flow field will be equal to 50. In most of the CFD packages, air is defined is the default working fluid. Hence, users should modify the working fluid via this menu using the pre-defined materials or defining a new material with unique physical and thermodynamical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem the entire CFD domain is filled with the defined working fluid. This working fluid is selected from the defined material/s in the previous step: `/define/boundary-conditions/fluid`. Users only need to assign the newly defined working fluid, the rest of the options remained unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow enters from the `inlet` face of the CFD domain with constant velocity of 1 [m/s] in x-direction. User sets the `velocity-inlet` condition to the face named `inlet` by defining the direction and magnitude of the velocity: `/define/boundary-conditions/velocity-inlet`. In cases where the incoming velocity into the CFD domain is not uniform, one can define the incoming velocity with the pre-defined directions or generate a User Define Function (UDF) to describe the velocity profile of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem the flow can exit the CFD domain from the `outlet` face and it's pressure will be equal to atmospheric pressure. User sets the `pressure-outlet` condition to these faces: `/define/boundary-conditions/pressure-outlet`. This simulates the physics of the problem of flow over a cylinder. Thus, it is assumed that gauge pressure at this boundary is equal to 0. If in the problem of interest there exists a specific pressure difference between the inlet and outlet or other surfaces, that magnitude can be defined in corresponding faces of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow interacts with the rotating cylinder located in the center of the CFD domain based on the `no-slip` boundary condition. User assign the `no-slip` boundary condition to the cylinder wall located in the center of the domain via `/define/boundary-conditions/wall` command. Furthermore, to impose a boundary to model rotation of this wall boundary, user assigns the boundary of the cylinder wall to be a moving boundary - Rotational. This condition along with the rate and axis of rotation is assigned using the path: `/define/boundary-conditions/wall/moving-wall/rotational`.\n",
    "In case studies the shear forces and formed boundary layer along the cylinder wall becomes turbulent users should either provide required mesh resolution to capture the phenomena or set this boundary to free slip condition such that fluid elements would not interact with wall region. However, for low Reynolds number flow, similar to the current problem of interest, a reasonable mesh resolution is sufficient to capture the laminar boundary layer region. If the shear forces and formed boundary layer becomes turbulent in this region user should either provide required mesh resolution to capture the phenomena or set this boundary to free slip condition such that fluid elements would not interact with wall region. For low Reynolds number flow, similar to the current problem of interest, a reasonable mesh resolution is sufficient to capture the laminar boundary layer region. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, it is highly recommended to use the default options and settings, unless based on physics of the problem the user is aware of any specific choices. Upon non-smooth convergence and potential divergence of the CFD simulation user can modify and examine various solution methods. To modify the solution methods and controls use the following commands respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "`solve/set/discretization-schem`\n",
    "\n",
    "`solve/set/under-relaxation`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all boundary conditions and settings for the CFD simulation are defined. User can **initialize** the solution through an educated guess to start the iteration process: `/solve/initialize/compute-defaults/velocity-inlet`. This solution initialization would incept the flow field variables, such as velocity and pressure, based on the defined values by user. For the current problem the CFD domain is recommended to be initialized using values of velocity and pressure at the pipe's inlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to the steady state case studies for the unsteady case studies the inputs for the time step size and number of time steps to solve the transient form of the flow field governing equations are required. Capturing the alternating vortex shedding from the cylinder walls in transient flow requires a time step that is low enough to account for the rapid temporal changes of the flow field velocity and other variables. \n",
    "There are multiple approaches to estimate the required values for these inputs. One of the most common approaches is a trial and error process to find the appropriate time step size. Users can choose an initial input values, visualize the obtained numerical solution of the flow using the animation playback sequence. Perior running the iterations, user creates a solution animation sequence via: `solve/calculation-activities/solution-animations`. Enabling this feature would let users to visualize and check the flow field for the accuracy of assigned time step size. In case the time step is too large the flow solution would skip over parts of the flow evolution, which can be seen in the animation by a non-smooth transition between frames. If the time step is too small, the solution will have more data than it is necessary for parts of the simulation, which increases computational costs, and it will be visualized in the animation by the frames changing slowly. For this problem, a time step size of 0.01 [s] is sufficient: `solve/run-calculation/time-step-size`. The number of time steps for this case should be at least 1000: `solve/run-calculation/number-of-time-steps` to allow for convergence to occur. As the rational speed increases, it is advised to increase the number of time steps as it takes more time to reach a steady like solution. Also to observe the disappearance of the vortices it takes more time. Suggested value is at least 5000 steps. Also chose the number of iterations per time step wisely. Provide enough time for the residuals to reach a very low value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration process for solving the flow field governing equation now shall start till converged solution is obtained: `solve/iterate`. A general rule of thumb for converged solution is to have continuity residuals of 10E-6. More details about commenting on validity of solution and convergence criteria will be discussed in next section."
