    "**The general method for solving a Fluid Mechanics problem analytically is to first understand the physics. Next is to understand the Boundary and Initial Conditions. We also have to make some baseline assumptions to simplify the problem.Making these assumptions may help us get a solution easily but we are sacrificing the acuracey of the solution here. Our solution may not reflect the actual physics but may give a better understanding of it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a CFD problem, we dont have to make so many assumptions as we make in an analytical soultion. We can mimic the actual set up of the problem to a good accuracy. In the present problem \"Flow over a rotating cylinder', the basic problem to be studied before this is the flow over a statinary cylinder and then leap to a rotating cylinder. When this problem was first studied, it was solved using \"Potential Flow Theory\". The concept of \"Boundary Layer\" wasn't developed then. The Potential Flow theory assumes that there are no viscous forces in the flow. This may not seem a good assumption at the beginning. We know that viscous forces play an important role in FLuid Mechanics problems and cannot be neglected. You may then ask the question \"Why do we study this?\". This theory, by neglecting the viscous forces, helps us better understand the cause for Lift generation. We are basically eliminating a variable which when taken into account may complicate the problem but which is not very important when you want to study the cause of lift.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential flow simplifies the problem by introducing a new variable called \"Streamfunction\" $\\psi$ which combines the two components of velocity into one (in a 2 dimensional problem). Now, instead of dealing with two variables, we have to deal with just one variable. We can assume the flow to be two-dimensional and incompressible and use the Laplce's Equation to find the Streamfunction. From the streamfunction we can find the velocity components. Bernoulli's Equation will give us the pressure distributions. This will give us a good estimate of the lift force.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more advantage of using Laplace's Equation is that it is linear. We can add streamfunctions of two flows to get the effect of the combined flow. A cylinder can be visualised by combinig an point source and a point sink close together in a uniform flow as shown in the figure 1 below. In cylindrical coordinates, the stream function can be writte as\n",

There is an agreement of both the results in the beginning ($\\theta$ from 180$\\deg$ to 135$\\deg$). For $\\theta$ <135$\\deg$, the inviscid solution predicts a much lower pressure than the experiment. In the experiments, the viscous effects are prominent. They cause the momentum of the fluid to be reduced which causes to pressure loss in the wake. Pressure is not fully recoverd in the wake. This pressure drop is a major contributor to the drag force on the cylinder. Another contributor for the drag force is the viscous effects but they are not as significant as the pressure drop. \n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 4 shows streamline pattern for increasing vortex strength. As we can see that the streamlines are more stacked at the top of the cylinder than at the bottom. The velocity of the fluid is more at the top than at the bottom. Consequently, the pressure at the top is less than that at the bottom. This pressure difference gives rise to a force in the direction of decreasing pressure called the **Lift.** This force increases with the strength of the vortex. Following the previous analysis we can prove that the resultant lift force (per unit span) is given by\n",

    "In a viscous fluid, a cylinder spinning in an otherwise uniform flow can generate lift. A thin layer of fluid in the boundary layer is forced to spin with the cylinder because of viscous friction, and its effect on the surrounding flow is similar to that produced by the vortex on the flow over a non-spinning cylinder. The spin produces circulation around the cylinder, and the strength of this \"virtual\" vortex depends on the spin rate of the cylinder. The appearance of a side force on a spinning cylinder or a sphere is called the *Magnus Effect*, after the Swedish physicist Gustav Magnus who first described it clearly in 1853. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we now know how Lift and Drag force are generated in flow around a rotating cylinder. Now the question arises - Why do we study this? Where can we use these results? The flow over a rotaing cylinder is one of the basic problems of Fluid Mechanics. The results from this study are used in many applications. We can study the lift generated on a golf ball, tennis ball, cricket ball etc. Another interesting phenomenon due to viscous effects is the vortex shedding in an unsteady flow. Periodic vortex shedding causes fluctuating forces on the cylinder, acoustic noise and fluid mixing among other several effects. The result of these fluctuating forces can be structural vibrations which can sometimes lead to structural failure due to resonance. Flow over a rotating cylinder is studied to understand the dynamics of flow around bridge piles, offshore oil legs etc. Thus we can see the importance of this study.\n",
