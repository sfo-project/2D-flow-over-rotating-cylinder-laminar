    "# CFD Results Post-Process & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final step for the development of a CFD simulation for a problem of interest is to process and examine the validity of the obtained numerical results (a.k.a post-processing and validation step). These steps requires an in-depth engineering knowledge about the fundamentals of the physical problem of interest. Thus, the value of investing time in understanding the fundamental physics of the flow, once again is highlighted here. This process is done starting from general inspection on CFD simulation results and ends with more detail validation process.**\n",

    "#### 1- Start with visualization of the residuals for most important variables within the flow field (e.g. continuity, streamwise velocity and etc.). Discuss how user should examine the residuals trends to comment on accuracy and convergence of the flow field's simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section discusses the results of the simulation for ** 2D Flow Over Rotating Cylinder**. The Reynolds number is 100. The first check point in any CFD Simulation is to observe the convergence of residuals of the variables. The variables can be 'Continuity', 'Momentum' etc. Residuals are differences in the value of a quantity between two iterations. A low value of residual indicates that the solution is converging. It means that futher iterations will have very small effect on the solution and the iteration can be stopped. The residual value of each variable denotes how the numerical value of that variable is differing from the previous time step. Lower value of residual indicates the obtained numerical value of the variable of interest has converged to a specific value. In this simulation this is true for COntinuity, U_x and U_y that have residual values by order of at least 1e-6. The reported continuity errors defines how the obtained relevant variables are satisfying the continuity equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of knowing whether the solution has converged is to look at the values of Lift coefficient ($C_L$) and Drag coefficient ($C_D$) at each timestep. The $C_L$ must attain a constant value or oscillate about a mean value. Same goes for $C_D$. The plot for $C_L$ is shown below. In this plot, alpha ($\\alpha$) is the non-dimensional rotation rate of the cylinder and is defined as $ \\alpha = R\\omega/U_\\infty$, where R is the radius of the cylinder, $\\omega$ is the rotation rate of the cylinder and $U_\\infty$ is the freestream velocity of the fluid. Figure 1 is the plot of $C_L$ with respect to flow time (timesteps) for different $\\alpha$. It is clear from the plot for $\\alpha = 0$, that after 130s of flow time, the value of $C_L$ starts to oscillate about a mean value of zero. This is a que to stop the iteration and know that the solution has attained a steady like solution. Similar trend is observed for higher rotation rates. For $\\alpha$ = 0, it seems like the solution starts with a constant value. Don not confuse this as a steady state. There are oscillations of $C_L$ in this range but due to the scale of the plot, they are not visible. Note that the value of mean $C_L$ for $\\alpha = 0$ is zero. When the cylinder is not rotating, the lift produced is zero as there is no magnus effect which is confirmed here. The plot of $C_D$ shows a similar trend. The values of $C_D$ start oscillating randomly and then attain a steady like solution oscillating about a mean value (different for different $\\alpha$).\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the solution has attained a steady like solution, next step is to look at the results. Start with mean values of $C_L$. The mean values of $C_L$ and $C_D$ are obtained from the plot of these variables vs flowtime as described earlier. The mean vales are the values about which these variables oscillate after reaching a steady like solution. As $\\alpha$ increases, $C_D$ decreases. The pressure drag decreases with increase in skin friction drag, resulting in a net decrease in total drag force. As $\\alpha$ increases, $C_L$ increases (look at the values on the y axis). This is due to Magnus effect produced by rotation of the cylinder. Due to counter-clockwise rotation, the streamlines stack at the bottom of the cylinder creating a low pressure region there. The pressure at the top is high and this pressure difference gives rise to a negative lift. As the roational velocity increases, the pressure difference increases and so does the lift force.\n",

    "Unsteady flow over cylinder gives rise to alternating vortex shedding behind the cylinder. This vortex shedding has a shedding frequency. A non dimensionl number, Strouhal number (St) is associated with this frequency. Strouhal number is defined as $St = D\\omega/U_\\infty$, where D is the diameter of the cylinder. When $D = 1$ and $U_\\infty =1$, St is simply $\\omega$ as in this case. Strouhal number is atio of the unsteadiness in the flow to inertial forces in the flow field. Calculate the value of St for different vlaues of $\\alpha$ and compare with other experimental and numerical results. Here the values are compared with the results of Kang et al (2006)[3] & Mittal and Kumar (2003)[4] (shown to compare the trend of St with α). The results seem to be in good agreement with each other with an difference of 6.25%. The CFD results do not exactly match the experimental values. THe experimental and CFD setups do not match exactly. It is also not possible to exactly recreate the experimental environment in the software. This leads to the variation in the results. The expected trend for Strouhal number is that it remains almost constant for the given range of $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 2$, the CFD value is decreased. The reason for this is not determined yet. \n",

    "User can also visualize the vortex shedding behind the cylinder using the case and date files exported at each time step.

    "Below is the figure showing vortex shedding for different $\\alpha$. Observe that the shedding is symmetric at $\\alpha = 0$. This is due to no-slip condition on the wall. The wake becomes narrower with increase in rotation rate. The strength of vorticity generated on the cylinder surface increases with the increase in spin rate. This is accompanied by an increase in the thickness of the region with closed streamlines around the cylinder. For vortex shedding to occur, vorticity of large enough strength must be carried to the outer flow, outside closed streamlines, via diffusion. This region of vorticity, in the outer flow, must also be a sufficiently large area of slowly moving, preferably recirculating\n",
    "fluid. Under these conditions the vorticity can pile up in a certain region of the flow and vortex shedding can take\n",
    "place. For α = 0, a large region behind the cylinder is associated with slowly moving fluid. The size of this region reduces, rapidly, with increase in spin rate. This explains the disappearance of vortex shedding for α ̴ 2.0.\n",

    "Above shown is the streamlines for different $\\alpha$. Observe the stagnation point shifting above the centerline as the rotational speed of the cylinder increases. As the cylinder rotates counterclockwise, the streamlines stack at the bottom shifting the stagnation point to the top. At α=1.5 see two stagnation points, one at the centerline in the front of the cylinder and another in the wake of the cylinder. This is due to the high rotational speed of the cylinder and formation of recirculation zone (flow separation). At α=2, the stagnation point shifts up again. Note that there is no stagnation point in the wake of the cylinder as there is no recirculation zone and no vortices are presenRemovet.\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "As the rotational speed of the cylinder increases, the drag force on the cylinder decreases. The pressure drag decreases with increase in skin friction drag, resulting in a net decrease in the total drag force. The lift force shows a reverse trend. The rotation of the cylinder in anticlockwise direction stacks the streamlines at the bottom of the cylinder giving rise to a low pressure region. Pressure at the top of the cylinder is high. This pressure difference gives rise to a negative lift (in the negative y-direction). This is called the Magnus Effect. As the rotational speed of the cylinder increases, the lift force increases. The rotation of the cylinder has very little effect on the Strouhal number. As the rotational speed of the cylinder increases, the Strouhal number remains almost same. This trend has been confirmed with\n",

    "The present work has significant implications for the flow control strategies that utilize rotating cylinder elements.\n",
    "It would be undesirable to use α < 2 because the flow is unstable.\n",
