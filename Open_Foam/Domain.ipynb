    "# CFD Domain's Creation & Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "**The next step for developing the CFD simulation for a case study, after the review of physics and theory behind the problem of interest, is to create the CFD/Computational domain. This CFD domain will first be created and then discretized into small finite elements (2D) or finite volumes (3D). The flow field's governing equations are then solved numerically inside these elements or volumes via an iterative process till a converged solution inside the CFD domain is obtained. This section explains the techniques and process of creation and discretization of the CFD domain for the problem of interest. It should be highlighted that this sections provides the most generic steps and techniques to create the CFD domain. Users can implement these steps/techniques in the mesher of their choice or download the pre-generated * .msh file from the \"Simulation_Src\" folder. The current tutorial provides methodological step-by-step  procedure to create the geometry of CFD domain and it's mesh in the official mesher package OpenFOAM, named blockMesh.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFD domain consists of a rotating cylinder with diameter of 1 [m], located in the center, surrounded by a larger cylinder with 64 [m] diameter. The inner cylinder would rotate around its central axis and interact with the incoming flow. The outer cylinder forms the exterior bounds of the CFD domain. The dimension for the diameter of the inner cylinder is chosen to be 1 [m] to ease the calculation of non-dimensional variables such as Reynolds number and Drag Coefficient. The diameter of the larger cylinder is chosen to be 64 times the diameter of the rotating cylinder to remove any potential uncertainties on the physics of the flow field due to high blockage effect. A schematic of the CFD domain's raw geometry is shown in Fig. 1. As visualized in Fig. 1 the flow enters the CFD domain from the left half of the outer circle with a constant uniform velocity and exits the domain from the right half with a specific constant uniform pressure. \n",

    "The `blockMesh` utility, as OpenFOAM's native hexahedral mesher, is used to create the raw geometry of the CFD domain. Furthermore, with `blockMesh` user can discretize the CFD domain raw geometry into finite blocks (i.e. finite volume or elements) and specify desired discretization resolution for entire domain or specific regions. This process is also referred to as \"meshing\" process. The `blockMesh` utility configurations and settings are stored in a text file named `blockMeshDict`, which is technically the \"Meshing Dictionary\" located in the 'system' folder of the working directory. In earlier versions of the OpenFOAM, prior to version 3.0.0, this `blockMeshDict` file is located in the `constant/polyMesh` directory. In OpenFOAM users usually start developing/customizing their own `blockMeshDict` file based of the previously developed files for similar or simpler case studies available in OpenFOAM tutorials. The current `blockMeshDict` file is developed based on the original OpenFOAM tutorial `blockMeshDict` file named `cavity` located in `FOAM_Tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity/system`. The reason behind this choice was the fact that cavity tutorial has one of the most basic `blockMeshDict` file to create and mesh a single block. Therefore, it could be easily expanded to create and mesh the geometry for the current case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking advantage of the CFD domain's symmetry, as visualized in Fig. 1, first only half of the geometry and it's mesh is created. Then using the mirror boolean operation, the full discretized CFD domain will be created. The half geometry is created using two separate quadrant blocks as shown in Fig. 2:\n",

    "Fig. 2. Two blocks forming half of the CFD domain's raw geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the two above-visualized blocks in Fig. 2 user should start editing the `blockMeshDict` file. The first line in the `blockMeshDict` file, after the header section, is the `convertToMeters` command line. This command performs scaling process on the final produced geometry and it's mesh. Since the units of the current case study is [m], the set value for this command would be 1. If the units of the case study would be [mm] or [km] the scaling factor of 0.001 or 1000 would be set respectively to perform the scaling process correctly.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to create the two visualized blocks in Fig. 2 by defining their corner vertices as the skeleton of the CFD domain's geometry. This is done by entering the coordinate of each vertex under the `vertices` command line as shown below in the `blockMeshDict` file:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these coordinates of these vertices reveals the fact that all of them are defined on two parallel xy planes with unit length offset. The reason behind this is that in OpenFOAM the concept of surface mesh is not defined! All mesh elements should be defined in 3D space. To model 2D case studies the `type` for boundaries in the third dimensions are defined as `empty`. More information and detail explanation on the boundary type can be read [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/boundaries/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above-defined vertices are automatically labeled numerically by `blockMesh` in the order that are input into the `blockMesh` file. First input vertex would be labeled with number 0, the second vertex would be labeled with number 1 and this labeling process continues up to the last input vertex. These labeling process is visualized in Fig. 3. Note that the red vertices are located in the third dimension (i.e z-direction) with respect to blue one with a unit depth offset.\n",

    "At this stage that the skeleton of the CFD domain's geometry is defined using vertices, the two visualized blocks in Fig. 2 are created by \"connecting\" these vertices together and simultaneously define the meshing process of them using the `blocks` command line in the `blockMeshDict` file. Each block is defined using one `hex` command. The inputs of the `hex` command are a list of vertex labels, described above, a 3D vector defining the number of mesh elements in each direction, and the type and list of cell expansion ratio in each direction as shown below. In this case study the number of mesh is chosen to be 100 and 200 in angular and radial direction respectively. Furthermore, the total expansion ratio in the radial direction is set to 80 distributed using `simpleGrading` algorithm. These are suggested mesh resolution according to the developer expertise. For unique and new case studies, user might perform mesh independency studies always starting with a coarse mesh and it's refinement as required.\n",

    "In the final step for `blockMeshDict` file setup, the location and type of the CFD domain boundaries are set. CFD domain boundaries are geometrical faces defined by the same vertices used in the blocking section. Each face is constructed by four vertices. A boundary can have one or more faces. In the simulation setup step user would impose the desired numerical condition to each boundary representing the physical role and fluid dynamics at their location (This step is fully discussed in the Simulation section). These conditions referred to as \"Boundary Conditions\" and their concept is identical to the definition of \"Boundary Conditions\" used to exactly solve the governing differential equations (i.e. governing equations of the flow field).\n",
    "\n",
    "The half domain boundary conditions are visualized in Fig. 6. There are five boundaries in the half domain; \"inlet\" face, where the flow enters the domain with a pre-defined velocity. \"outlet\", where the flow exits the domain with a constant pressure. \"wall\", where walls of the cylinder is defined and flow interacts with it. \"symm\" (symmetric), where flow condition is reflected with respect to it and \"frontAndBack\" which is the boundary in the third dimension.\n",
