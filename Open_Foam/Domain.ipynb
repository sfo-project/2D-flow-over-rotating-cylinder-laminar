    "# CFD Domain's Creation & Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "**The next step for developing the CFD simulation for a case study, after the review of physics and theory behind the problem of interest, is to create the CFD/Computational domain. This CFD domain will first be created and then discretized into small finite elements (2D) or finite volumes (3D). The flow field's governing equations are then solved numerically inside these elements or volumes via an iterative process till a converged solution inside the CFD domain is obtained. This section explains the techniques and process of creation and discretization of the CFD domain for the problem of interest. It should be highlighted that this sections provides the most generic steps and techniques to create the CFD domain. Users can implement these steps/techniques in the mesher of their choice or they can use the following provided steps to produce the mesh in OpenFOAM.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain consists of a rotating cylinder with diameter of 1 [m] surrounded by a larger cylinder with 64 [m] diameter. The inner cylinder would interact with the incoming flow while rotating around its central axis. The outer cylinder forms the exterior boundary of the domain. The dimension for the diameter of the inner cylinder is chosen to be unit in order to ease the calculation of various field variables such as Reynolds number. The diameter of the bounded cylinder is chosen to be 64 times the diameter of the main cylinder to ensure that the exterior boundaries do not effect the fluid flow in the near field of the rotating cylinder. A schematic of the geometry is shown in Fig.1:\n",

    "The flow enters the CFD domain from the left half of the outer circle with a fixed velocity value and exits the domain from the right half with a specific pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meshing process is going to be done by blockMesh utility, the OpenFOAM native hexahedral mesher. Using blockMesh, one can divide the domain into multiple blocks, define mesh resolutions for each block and finally produce a high quality structural mesh. Here at first, two quadrant-shaped blocks which form the half geometry of the problem are going to be produced. Then by a mirroring process, the full geometry will be obtained. The two blocks are shown in Fig.2:\n",

    "Fig. 2. The forming blocks of the geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meshing procedure using blockMesh is quite easy. At the first step the vertices of the blocks are going to be defined. Next the two mentioned blocks are going to be defined based on the previously mentioned vertices and the resolution of the edges are going to be specified. the last step would be defining the boundaries of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blockMesh utility options are stored in a file named blockMeshDict which has to be located in the system directory of the working case. The blockMeshDict file can be copied from the tutorials provided by OpenFOAM itself. Among all tutorials, the cavity tutorial has the most basic written blockMeshDict file with only one block defined. The blockMeshDict file for this tutorial is located in $FOAM_Tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity/system. This file has to be copied into the system directory of our own case.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the first line of the blockMeshDict file (After the header section of the file), There is a keyword named convertToMeters which does a scaling process on the final produced mesh. If the units are considered as [m] in a case (Which are in our case) then the value of this keyword would be 1.\n",

You can find better explanation on this type of boundary condition in [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/boundaries/).\n",
