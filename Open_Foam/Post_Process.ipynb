    "# CFD Results Post-Process and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final step for the development of a CFD simulation for a problem of interest is to process and examine the validity of the obtained numerical results (a.k.a post-processing and validation step). This steps requires an in-depth engineering knowledge about the fundamentals of the physical problem of interest. Thus, the value of investing time in understanding the fundamental physics of the flow, once again is highlighted here. This process is done starting from general inspection on CFD simulation results and ends with more detail validation process.**\n",

    "The obtained results for 2D laminar flow over a rotating cylinder with Reynolds of 100 (Re=100) and Tip Speed Ratio of 1 (TSR=1) is processed and discussed in this section. The first general rule of thumb to check the convergence of a CFD simulation is to check the residual and error values for key flow variables, such as continuity, velocity and pressure. In OpenFoam the residual values for velocity components and pressure along with error values for continuity are printed out at each time step as set in the `controlDict` dictionary file. A sample of time report is shown below for the last time step `t=150`:\n",

    "The residual value of each variable denotes how the numerical value of that variable is differing from the previous time step. Lower value of residual indicates the obtained numerical value of the variable of interest has converged to a specific value. In this simulation this is true for `U_x`, `U_y` and `p` that have residual values by order of at least `1e-6`. The reported `continuity errors` defines how the obtained relevant variables are satisfying the continuity equation. The global continuity error with order of `1e-13` in this problem confirms that continuity equation is being satisfied.\n",

Running the command `foamJob -s pimpleFoam` before starting the iterations and then in the end od simulation running the command `foamLog log` inside the main working directory will make a history of log files for different flow field variables inside a new directory called `logs`. Changing the directory into `logs` directory and running `gnuplot` command, user can plot the obtained numerical residuals.

    "The second step of post-processing is to visualize dimensionless form of the important flow field variables within the CFD domain. This visualization step can be problem specific and should be performed over an adequate plane of choice, which will be explained for the current case study shortly. To post-process the obtained numerical results in OpenFoam it is recommended to use the post-processor package of OpenFoam called `ParaView`. `ParaView` can be launched running the command\n",

    "\n",
    "For most of the problems visualization of normalized velocity or pressure contours over a horizontal or vertical plane at the center of the CFD domain is a good start point for post-processing the obtained numerical data. For the current problem, since the entire domain is two dimensional and planar, the entire domain itself is the best candidate of post-processing plane. User should now define the normalized variable of interest needs to be visualized. Defining variables can be done following path of `Filters/Data Analysis/Calculator`. This command will open a new panel under `Properties`, where users can define their variable of interest; Name the variable (i.e. `U_norm`) and enter the required formula/definition for the normalized variable of interest (i.e. `U_x/1`) and hit `Apply`. This will calculate the normalized streamwise velocity with free stream velocity within the entire CFD domain for all the time steps and visualize the results for `t=0`. Using the `play` bottom users can see the formation of laminar boundary layer and wake around and in the back of the rotating cylinder:"

    "Fig. 2 - Animation of the normalized streamwise velocity contours with the free stream velocity for flow over a rotating cylinder with $Re=100$ and $TSR$=1 at `t=150`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 2 visualizes the evolution of the normalized streamwise velocity with free stream for flows with $Re=100$ and $TSR=1$. The Flow enters the domain with normalized velocity of 1. Due to the imposed no-slip boundary conditions over the surface of cylinder, the velocity instantly decrease to zero on the nose of the cylinder and a laminar boundary layer starts to form and grow around the cylinder's surface. After few time steps due to the unsteadiness of the flow at Re=100, vortices start to form and shed from the top and bottom of the cylinder in to it's wake. This flow field behavior of the flow over a rotating cylinder with $TSR=1$ is very similar to the flow field pattern in the case of fixed cylinder in which the $TSR=0$. Two main differences between these two cases is that in the case of rotating cylinder, due to the cylinder rotation, the vortex shedding frequency is lower and the wake of the cylinder gets an asymmetric shape in the direction of cylinder rotation. Increasing the TSR of the cylinder (i.e. the angular speed) the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the cylinder gradually decreases and after a critical TSR value of the vortex shedding will completely be suppressed (i.e. vortex shedding frequency of zero). \n",

    "In order to confirm the above mentioned hypotheses users can visualize the vorticity field within the CFD domain for two different case studies with Re=100 and TSR or 0.5 and 2. In order to perform this step of post-processing users have to first calculate the vorticity field at different time steps by closing the open ParaView session and running the following command while locating in the working directory:\n",

    "Suppression of the vortex shedding in the wake of the rotating cylinder removes the previously existing pressure gradient across the cylinder, due to pre-existing low-pressure region just behind the cylinder. As a result of this phenomena a lower drag forceis experienced by the cylinder compared to the case study of stationary cylinder. On the other other side of the spectrum, rotation of the cylinder leads to a velocity gradient, hence a pressure gradient, between the top and bottom of the cylinder as visualized in Fig. 2(b). This gradient will lead to a force acting normal to streamwise flow direction and generates a \"lift force\". This is an entirely new phenomena, compared to the stationary cylinder, due to the rotation of the cylinder and is called the **Magnus Effect** . It should be recalled that in the case of stationary cylinder, due to the flow field symmetry, the normal component of the forces exerted on the cylinder's wall would cancel each other out and lift force will be almost zero. For more information on the topic of **Magnus Effect** please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "**After performing the general post-processing steps, the user need to perform more detail oriented post-processing to confirm the validity of the CFD simulation. This stage can be a state-of-the-art. Comparing the numerical results against the theory (discussed earlier) or any other available experimental results is the final stage of post-processing. It is extremely important to calculate the correct corresponding numerical variables and compare them against the experimental or other numerical data.**\n",

    "In order to validate the obtained numerical results from these simulations the numerically predicted drag and lift coefficients for the simulated rotating cylinder were compared against corresponding values from another numerical study by [Stojković et. al.](http://cfd.mace.manchester.ac.uk/twiki/pub/Main/FlettnerRotors/Stojkovic_PoF_2002.pdf) for flow field with $Re=100$ with different Tip Speed Ratios (TSR). The drag and lift coefficients are defined as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "In these equations $F_D$ and $F_L$, are the total drag and lift force due to pressure and viscous forces within the flow acting on the cylinder's surface in the streamwise and normal direction. These force values are normalized with the available momentum within the undisturbed incoming flow that could be exerted on the cylinder. The value of this momentum is calculated using $\\rho_{ref}$ as the reference density of the flow, which is the density of the flow. $V_{ref}$ as the undisturbed streamwise flow velocity in the inlet and $A_{proj}$, which is the projected area of the cylinder surface. For a two-dimensional cylinder the projected area is equal to the diameter of the cylinder. This is the area where pressure and viscus forces are acting on the cylinder in the streamwise direction. It should be noted that the pressure and viscous forces in the perpendicular direction to streamwise direction cancel each other. Hence, the forces and areas that they act on does not have any contribution to the drag force and coefficient.\n",

    "In the numerical simulations user can take advantage of pre-written functions and libraries to calculate and report both drag and lift coefficient values. As discussed earlier the \"forceCoeffs\" function, added to `controlDict` dictionary file located in `\\system` directory, takes \"cylinder\" walls as the patch and calculates the forces on in the defined directions.

    "As shown in the Table 1 the values of the relative error percentages for $C_D$ are below 2.1% for case studies with relatively low TSR values (below 1.5). Furthermore, Table 1 reveals that for TSR value of 2 and above the relative error percentage of corresponding drag coefficient values increases significantly. The reason behind this is the increase of the TSR value result into more complex physics of the flow field, especially right behind the cylinder were viscous effects become dominant in this region, which was discussed in great details in the physics sections. As long as the flow regime is laminar this error can be reduced by either decreasing the time step value of the simulation from 0.01 second and/or using more accurate numerical schemes. However, if increasing the TSR value lead into change of a flow regime from Laminar to Transitional or Turbulent flow, adequate mesh resolution and if required numerical scheme should be used to accurately estimated the drag coefficient of the rotating cylinder and simulate the flow field around and in the wake of the cylinder. \n",

As shown in Table 1 the relative error of numerically simulated lift coefficient values were less than 1% in all cases. The hypothesis for this low relative error value, despite large corresponding values for drag coefficients, is that the physics of the flow field on the top and bottom points on the cylinder wall are yet simple and viscous effect in these regions is not significant. This was one of the key reasons presented and discussed in the physics section to explain why using potential theory is a valid tool to investigate this flow field theoretically. Now this is being validated using the CFD simulations. Furthermore, Table 1 also confirms that increase of TSR value lead to stronger Magnus effect and larger lift coefficient as discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage one can conclude that this CFD numerical simulation is validated to study unsteady laminar flow over a rotating cylinder. Therefore, these simulations can be used for similar or more complex problems, such as three dimensional laminar flow over a rotating cylinder or sphere. This can be done via correct implementation in changing the corresponding solver, models and/or boundary conditions."
